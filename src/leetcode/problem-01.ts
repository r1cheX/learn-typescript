// give me a sentence of problem about a easy leet code problem
// to doing it in ts

// Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers 
// such that they add up to a specific target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
// and you may not use the same element twice.

// Example:

// Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

// Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
// return [0, 1].

// give me the declaration of the method

export function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    const aea = 2;
    return [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11];
}
